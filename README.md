uwastromsg
==========

A script for emailing reminders/warnings to grads about pizza and w(h)ine time duties. All of the documentation you could need is in the docstring at the beginning of the file `uwastromsg.py`. 

Remember to update the wiki when creating or changing assignments for [pizza lunch](http://librarian.phys.washington.edu/astro/index.php/Pizza_lunch) and [w(h)ine time](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/mjt29/whinetime.html) (<< This is a link to Michael's whine time page, not a wiki page. Should we make one?)
