uwastromsg
==========

A script for emailing reminders/warnings to grads about pizza and w(h)ine time duties. @tzdwi's version makes and sends the birthday emails. All of the documentation you could need is in the docstring at the beginning of the file `uwastromsg.py`. 

People's birthdays can be found on the [wiki](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/w/index.php?title=Community:Phone_List)
